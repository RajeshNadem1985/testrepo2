GIT --> Distributed revision/ version control system

Repo = Folder root

problems without VCS:
---------------------

1. File content cant be tracked before some timstamp
2. Since you store the files in your HD, it may crash
3. collaberation is really problem, multiple persons cant change the file at a time. concurrency
4. Tagging --> later classes
5. Branching

1st generation:
---------------
only 1 person can open file while he is open other one cant open, until closing the file by 1st person so that
second person can able to open.

2nd generation: centralized control system - SVN
------------------------------------------------
having only center(cloud) in btwn developer1 & developer2

if we have developed one with all fecilities later natural disaster happened so everything is gone so that crisis 
bcz we ket all development in 1 ceenter


3rd generation: distributed or de- centralized - GIT
----------------------------------------------------
de-centralized: we distribute developments in different locations even if location destroyed through other developements area
se can deveop easily which is destroyed.

if remote repo is crashed then all the local repos & working copys in laptops/desktops(lap 1, lap 2) will be crashed which is cloned from 
remote repo. but lap3 is not cloned but through using 3rd lappy we can restore whole history of remote repo the data which holds

i.e, if central server crashes we can easily restore the data back with all history & with all branches


** branching & merging features are improved in GIT over SVN
